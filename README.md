Introduction to kivy
==========

A project based introduction to kivy. The sample project is a workout logging app.

This is meant to be an instructor-guided introduction to kivy for an audience who is familiar with the basics of python. The presentation first gives an overview of kivy, then is divided into topics. For each topic, there is sample code and a working version of the app in the corresponding folder (see below). There is also a packaged android version of the app in the bin folder. 

For each topic, the presentation gives an explanation of the existing code followed by an exercise for the audience to work through. The topics are:

01: building blocks: Explains the building blocks of kivy using only python

02: kivy language: Introduces the kivy language

03: buttons and binding: How to add buttons and bind functions to them

04: nested layouts: Nesting layouts can not only provide structure, but decrease repetition

The presentation also includes a brief description of ways to package for android, with a focus on the buildozer tool.
